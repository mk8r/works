  overview: "Stella’s Room Studio is a premier beauty and tattoo artistry academy based in DFW, Texas. They offer professional training in microblading, fine line tattooing, 3D areola tattooing, lip blushing, and nano brow artistry. The main goal was to increase enrollments for their training programs while maintaining cost-efficiency and local relevance.",
  
  approach: "The campaign began with in-depth keyword research around high-intent search terms like 'microblading training DFW' and 'fine line tattoo course'. I structured tightly themed search campaigns, each aligned to a specific service with custom ad copy and landing page extensions. Geographic targeting focused on the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area, ensuring only local, motivated prospects saw the ads. I optimized conversions through detailed ad testing, negative keyword curation, and smart bidding strategies (Maximize Conversions with TCPA). Retargeting was layered to capture visitors exploring training details but not yet ready to register.",

  date: "September 2025",
  description: "Engineered a fully customized, event-driven analytics framework for SERP Institute using GA4 and GTM - transforming surface-level web metrics into rich, actionable behavioral insights.",
  
  overview: "SERP Institute is an education-focused organization dedicated to providing high-quality academic resources and professional development content online. Their website features a wide range of downloadable learning materials and audio-based lessons. The challenge was that traditional analytics only captured basic metrics - pageviews and simple events - offering little understanding of how users engaged with specific resources or media.",
  
  approach: "To deliver true behavioral intelligence, I architected a comprehensive GA4 + GTM event model capturing detailed user interactions with non-standard site elements. The project had two core pillars: enhanced file download tracking and HTML5 audio engagement measurement. For downloadable content, GTM was configured to dynamically log the exact file_name parameter (e.g., 'Student Booklet', 'Teacher Edition') for every file download event. This granular tracking allows SERP Institute to analyze content performance at a resource level. For media analytics, I developed a custom JavaScript listener integrated within GTM to detect user actions in embedded HTML5 audio players. These interactions push structured data - including playback status, audio title, duration, URL, and percent listened - to GA4, offering precise insight into how educational audio content is consumed.",

  date: "November 2025",

  overview: "RA Plumbing & Heating is a trusted Nottingham-based home services company specializing in boiler installation, heating repairs, and plumbing solutions across the UK. Despite having strong local reputation, their online lead generation was underperforming - limited reach, inconsistent conversions, and inefficient ad spend. The goal was simple yet powerful: build a paid acquisition system that delivers steady, qualified leads without wasting a pound of budget.",
  
  approach: "I began with an in-depth market and keyword analysis, zeroing in on high-intent local search terms such as 'boiler installation Nottingham', 'new boiler cost', and 'emergency boiler fitting near me'. Campaigns were structured into tightly themed ad groups focused on service type and urgency. Custom ad copy was crafted to emphasize reliability, quick response, and competitive pricing - the key emotional triggers for homeowners facing heating issues. I built a conversion funnel using dedicated landing pages optimized for lead capture and credibility (trust badges, reviews, and instant quote CTAs). Within the first 7 days, the campaign reached full performance stride, consistently generating quality inquiries at an exceptional cost-per-lead ratio.",

  overview: "In My Voice - Lenora’s World of Stories & Music is a heartfelt YouTube channel dedicated to inspiring children through stories, songs, and emotional learning. Each video nurtures kindness, confidence, and creativity while guiding parents with meaningful ways to connect. Despite having beautifully crafted content, the channel faced limited visibility and slow organic growth. The goal was to amplify reach, attract the right audience, and build a genuine, loyal community around Lenora’s mission.",
  
  approach: "The campaign began with a deep audience analysis to uncover where parents and children were already consuming similar educational and emotional development content. Using Google’s Demand Gen campaigns, I developed a multi-layered targeting structure based on interests, family-related demographics, and placement targeting on relevant storytelling and parenting channels. Ad creatives were optimized for engagement and emotional resonance, featuring short clips that reflected the warmth and positivity of Lenora’s brand. Careful budget pacing and constant creative testing ensured maximum visibility without overspend. Within seven days, engagement metrics began climbing sharply, and by the end of the first month, the channel had crossed the 10,000-subscriber milestone with thousands of meaningful interactions.",
